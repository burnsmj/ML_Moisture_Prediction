Moisture_Uptake_FarmCPU.R
  - Runs FarmCPU to perform a GWAS on the genetic and predicted moisture uptake data.
  - Requires My_Y_Env_X.csv, GD_Env_X.txt, GAPIT.Genotype.map.txt, GAPIT.PCA.csv, and FarmCPU.p.threshold.optimize.moisture_uptake_X.txt
  - Produces Manhattan Plot, SNP significance dataset, etc.

Numerical_GAPIT.R
  - Runs GAPIT to get the numeric genomic dataset, genomic map dataset, and the PCA of the genotypes.
  - Requires christine_common_final.hmp.txt
  - Produces GAPIT.Genotype.Numerical.txt, GAPIT.Genotype.map.txt, and GAPIT.PCA.csv

Splitting_BLUPs_by_Env.R
  - The purpose of this script is to split BLUP data by environment
  - Requires N5000_Master_With_Predictions.csv and christine_common_final.hmp.txt
  - Produces MyY_Env_X.csv
  - This will not produce a dataset of the SNPs in each environment, see the perl script GWAS_Env_Splitter.pl for this
  
p_value_GAPIT.R
  - Produces the permuted p-value dataset which is used to determine SNP significance
  - Requires My_Y_Env_X.csv, GD_Env_X.csv, and GAPIT.Genotype.map.txt
  - Produces FarmCPU.p.threshold.optimize.moisture_uptake_X.txt
  
GWAS_Env_Splitter.pl
  - This script goes through the numeric dataset line by line and determines if the genotype is present in a given environment.  If it is, it adds it to the list of genotypes and SNPs for that given environment.
  - Requires MyY_Taxa_Env_X.txt and GAPIT.Genotype.Numerical.txt
  - Produces GD_Env_X.txt
  
GWAS_QC.sh
  - A file to run QC on the SNP datasets (includes checking the number of lines in common, the number of taxa in each, etc)
  - Requires MyY_Env_X.csv and GD_Env_X.txt
  - Produces MyY_Taxa_Env_X.txt (other files are created, but not important).

Plink_Script.sh
  - Uses plink to turn a plink file set into a bed file.
  - Requires a binary plink dataset.
  - Produces a bedfile of the binary hapmap.
  - This script was used separately for both the full dataset as well as the significant SNP dataset.

GCTA_GRM_Script.sh
  - Uses gcta64 to turn a bedfile into a grm file set. 
  - Requires a bedfile.
  - Produces a GRM file set.
  - This script was used separately for both the full dataset as well as the significant SNP dataset.
  
GCTA_PVE_Script.sh
  - Uses gcta64 to calculate the variance explained by a SNP dataset.
  - Requires a GRM file set and a phenotype file with the correct family ID column (in this case a column of -9).
  - Produces a log file from which the PVE (V(G) / Vp) can be extracted. 
  - This script was used separately for both the full dataset as well as the significant SNP dataset.

  
In All of the above scripts, an X in the name of a file indicates a value of 1-5.

These scripts should be run in the following order:
1. Numerical_GAPIT.R
2. Splitting_BLUPs_by_Env.R
3. GWAS_Env_Splitter.pl
4. GWAS_QC.sh (Not Required)
5. p_value_GAPIT.R
6. Moisutre_Uptake_FarmCPU.R
7. In TASSEL GUI - binarize the SNP calls (Load hapmap data into TASSEL GUI, select Filter > Filter Genotype Table Sites > Check the box for Remove Minor SNP States)
8. Save the hapmap dataset as a plink file
9. Plink_Script.sh
10. GCTA_GRM Script
11. GCTA_PVE_Script.sh
12. Manually extract Vg / Vp
13. Repeat 7 - 13 for just the significant SNPs
